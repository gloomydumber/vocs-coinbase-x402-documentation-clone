# The best way to accept digital payments.

# 1 Line of Code to Accept Digital Dollars

Just add a **single line of code** in your app, and you can require a USDC payment for each incoming request.

```javascript
paymentMiddleware("0xYourAddress", { "/your-endpoint": "$0.01" });
// and thats it!
```

If a request arrives without payment, the server responds with HTTP 402, prompting the client to pay and retry.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
```

x402 allows any web developer to accept crypto payments without the complexity of having to interact with the blockchain.
